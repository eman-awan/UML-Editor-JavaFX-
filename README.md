# UML Editor

## Overview
The UML Editor is a desktop-based application developed using **JavaFX** that allows users to create and manage **UML diagrams** in a structured and user-friendly environment.  
The project focuses on applying **object-oriented design principles**, **layered architecture**, and **software engineering best practices**.

This tool helps visualize system designs by enabling users to create UML components in an organized and maintainable way.

## Problem Statement
Designing UML diagrams manually or using complex tools can be time-consuming and unintuitive for beginners.  
The goal of this project was to build a **simple yet functional UML diagram editor** that demonstrates core software engineering concepts such as modular design, separation of concerns, and version control.

---

## Features
- Create and manage UML diagrams
- Layered architecture for better maintainability
- Object-oriented design implementation
- Interactive and user-friendly GUI using JavaFX
- Clean separation between UI, business logic, and data handling
- Version-controlled development using Git

---

## Technologies Used
- **Java**
- **JavaFX**
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **Layered Architecture**
- **Git & GitHub**

---

## Project Architecture
The application follows a **layered architecture**, typically including:
- **Presentation Layer** – Handles UI components using JavaFX
- **Business Logic Layer** – Manages UML diagram operations and validations
- **Data Layer** – Handles data structures and diagram persistence (if applicable)

This architecture improves scalability, readability, and maintainability.
